# Problem

The project is solving the problem of situations around the world that affect privacy and communication security. Also this project aims to protect users from the physical attack of being forced to open their phone. For example in case of control at a border post by intelligence services, the theft of phones in order to try to analyze the device, the unexpected control by the police in the street, forcing the citizen to unlock their phone.

# Solution

We solve the problem with what we call the “It’s just a Game sir” Feature. This is why we provide a game that aims to "lock" the messaging app, so that if someone is trying to find the user private messages, he won't be able to find it in this app that looks like a game and that is a game, unless you know how to reveal the messaging app hidden in it.

# Installation

First we install dependencies using `yarn`

```
cd berty/tool/game-utils/bundler
yarn
cd ../pkg-validator
yarn
cd ../game-dev-app
yarn
cd ../../../..
```

And then if you are on Mac

```
sh build.sh
```

Or if you are on Windows or Linux

```
sh build-android.sh
```

# How to Use

To unlock the messaging app, simply start playing the flappybat game, and when you loose, enter "4242" as a name.
